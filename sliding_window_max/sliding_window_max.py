Input: a List of integers as well as an integer `k` representing the size of the sliding window
Returns: a List of integers

# First-Pass Solution
# Find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size k

# Approach: run a nested loop, the outer loop which will mark the starting point of the subarray of length k, 
# the inner loop will run from the starting index to index+k, 
# k elements from starting index 
# and print the maximum element among these k elements
    
# 1.Create a nested loop, the outer loop from starting index to n-k th elements. The inner loop will run for k iterations
# 2.Create a variable to store the maximum of k elements traversed by the inner loop
# 3.Find the maximum of k elements traversed by the inner loop
# 4.Print the maximum element in every iteration of outer loop

# method to find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of s of size k
def sliding_window_max(arr, k):
    max = 0
    x = []
    # create a nested loop, the outer loop from starting index to nums - k th elements
    for i in range(len(arr) - k + 1): 
        max = arr[i]
        # The inner loop will run for k iterations
        # create a variable to store the maximum of k elements traversed by the inner loop
        for j in range(1, k):
            if arr[i + j] > max:
                # find the maximum of k elements traversed by the inner loop
                max = arr[i + j]
        # print the maximum element in every iteration of outer loop
        x.append(max)

    return x
